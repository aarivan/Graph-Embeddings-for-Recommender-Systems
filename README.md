# Graph-Embeddings-for-Recommender-Systems
In this project, we will revisit the problem central to recommender systems: predicting a user’s preference for some item they have not yet rated. Like the Spark recommender from the first project, we will use a collaborative filtering model to explore this problem. Recall that in this model, the goal is to find the sentiment of a user about a particular item Unlike the the first project that used the ALS method, however, we will perform this task using a graphbased technique called DeepWalk.
